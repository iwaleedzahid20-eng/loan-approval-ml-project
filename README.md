# Loan Approval Prediction – Retail Credit Risk Analytics

## Business Problem
Commercial banks receive thousands of personal loan applications every month.  
Manually evaluating these applications is time-consuming and may lead to inconsistent decisions.

The objective of this project is to:
- Understand key factors influencing loan approval decisions
- Build predictive machine learning models to estimate loan approval probability
- Design an explainable and risk-aware underwriting approach
- Ensure the solution is production-ready and interpretable for business stakeholders

This project simulates a **real-world retail credit underwriting use case** in a commercial bank.
